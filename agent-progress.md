**Category**: infrastructure
**Dependencies**: F001
**Estimated Effort**: Small

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Vite config includes base path '/klondike/' for GitHub Pages project site
2. All asset paths resolve correctly with base path prefix
3. PWA manifest start_url and scope configured for /klondike/ path
4. Production build works locally with 'npm run preview'

##### F041: GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
**Priority**: 1 (Critical)
**Category**: infrastructure
**Dependencies**: F040
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Workflow file exists at .github/workflows/deploy.yml
2. Workflow triggers on push to main branch
3. Workflow runs npm install, build, and deploys to gh-pages
4. Uses GitHub Pages action for deployment
5. Build artifacts include all PWA assets

##### F042: SPA routing support (404.html)
**Priority**: 2 (High)
**Category**: infrastructure
**Dependencies**: F040, F023
**Estimated Effort**: Small

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. 404.html file redirects to index.html with path preserved
2. index.html handles the redirect and restores correct route
3. Direct navigation to /klondike/game works correctly
4. Browser back/forward navigation works after redirect

##### F043: Router basename configuration
**Priority**: 2 (High)
**Category**: infrastructure
**Dependencies**: F023, F040
**Estimated Effort**: Small

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. React Router basename configured to '/klondike'
2. All internal links work correctly with base path
3. Navigation between home, game, and help pages works
4. URL shows correct path (e.g., /klondike/game not just /game)

**Priority**: 3 (Medium)
**Category**: testing
**Dependencies**: F040, F041
**Estimated Effort**: Medium

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Smoke test verifies https://thomasrohde.github.io/copilot-experiment/ loads

### Session 3 - Professional Card Assets Integration
**Date**: 2025-12-05
**Duration**: ~10 minutes
**Focus**: Replace generated card SVGs with professional assets from Vector-Playing-Cards

#### Completed
- Selected Vector-Playing-Cards repo (https://github.com/notpeter/Vector-Playing-Cards)
  - License: Public Domain / WTFPL - fully open for commercial use
  - High-quality traditional playing card designs by Byron Knoll
- Created download script (`scripts/download-pro-cards.ts`):
  - Downloads all 52 card SVGs from GitHub raw content
  - Renames files from VPC format (e.g., `AH.svg`) to project format (e.g., `a_of_hearts.svg`)
  - Backs up existing generated cards before replacement
  - ESM-compatible with proper `__dirname` handling
- Successfully downloaded all 52 professional card face SVGs
- Backed up original generated cards to `public/cards-generated-backup/`
- Created LICENSE.txt documenting asset attribution and license
- Retained custom card back designs (Vector-Playing-Cards doesn't include backs)
- Updated features.json:
  - Updated F013: Now specifies professional Vector-Playing-Cards assets
  - Added F031: Card asset download script feature
  - Marked F013 and F031 as passing
- Verified build passes with new assets

#### Files Created
- `scripts/download-pro-cards.ts` - Asset download automation script
- `public/cards/LICENSE.txt` - Asset attribution and license documentation

#### Files Changed
- `public/cards/*.svg` - All 52 card faces now professional SVGs
- `features.json` - Updated F013, added F031, updated metadata

#### Directories Created
- `public/cards-generated-backup/` - Backup of original generated cards

#### Blockers Discovered
- None

#### Recommended Next Steps
1. Start dev server and verify cards render correctly in browser
2. Test drag-and-drop functionality with new card assets
3. Consider adding more card back design options
4. Continue verifying remaining features with end-to-end browser testing

#### Technical Notes
- Vector-Playing-Cards uses naming format: `{Rank}{Suit}.svg` (e.g., `AH.svg`, `10C.svg`)
- Project uses format: `{rank}_of_{suit}.svg` (e.g., `a_of_hearts.svg`)
- Download script handles the mapping automatically
- Card backs not available from VPC - retained generated designs

---

```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Pure game logic**: All game rules in `src/game/` with no UI dependencies
2. **Immutable state**: Zustand + Immer for predictable state updates
3. **Type safety**: Strict TypeScript with discriminated unions for moves
4. **Responsive design**: CSS Grid for layout, works on mobile and desktop
